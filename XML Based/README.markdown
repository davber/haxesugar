# haXe Sugar 0.2.1
> Updated 5/20/2009

## Description

An Espresso plugin (or sugar) for haXe development. Based on the ActionScript 3 sugar
by Mike Murray.

* Syntax Highlighting, Code Completion for many of the classes and reserved words
* Includes classes from the packages: flash, fl, adobe and air
* Compilation using the 'haxe' command-line tool
* Support for haXe and HXML syntaxes

## Instructions

### Installing Sugar

* From Source
** Download source, compile with XCode, start Espresso.
* RCompiled Version
** Download, double click, start Espresso.

### Configuring Compilers

* Install haXe from http://www.haxe.org

## Useage

* While editing an *.hx hit cmd + enter or Action -> haXe -> Build from the menu to build the file.

## Other Info

* Again, based it on the ActionScript 3 sugar by Mike Murray. I feel like a thief,
  but hopefully this will make the (growing?) haXe community happy. They do need code
	completion, to be as cool as their VB.NET peers.
